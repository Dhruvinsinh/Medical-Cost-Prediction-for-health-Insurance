# Medical-Cost-Prediction-for-health-Insurance
predict insurance costs as accuracte as possible Using Neural network deep learning technique
The dataset Content is as follows:
Columns

age: age of primary beneficiary

sex: insurance contractor gender, female, male

bmi: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height,
objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9

children: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents

smoker: Smoking

region: the beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.

charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance

Where We have age,sex,bmi,children,smoker,region as Input feature for Our neural network algorithm and charges for target or prediction column for the neural network.
